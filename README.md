# protest.wtf
âœŠ Going to a protest and you donâ€™t know wtf to do? This resource aims to provide you with information to prepare yourself. 

## Purpose
This guide was created to easily share information for new and experienced protestors to protect themselves. Activist information is often shared via PDF through private, anonymous channels for security. In 2020, folks who want to show up donâ€™t have the time, network, or resources to find buried information. This guide compiles written and oral history tactics and tips into a format that is fully open and accessible.
